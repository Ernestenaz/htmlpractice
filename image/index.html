        <strong> power is an important component for the 
        development of any economy and hence for prosperity.</strong>
        According to World Bank report [7], in 2015, 
        about 75 million Nigerians lacked access to adequate electricity and Nigeria was ranked highest amongst the countries with electricity access deficit when energy access, efficiency and renewable are on the rise in many developing nations. Much of the electricity distribution network at 2010 -2016 was poorly maintained and the supply in a lot of areas was often described as epileptic in nature, characterized by extreme voltage variations, load discharges, frequent and long outages and reliance by small scale businesses, industries and affluent individuals on off-grid generation.
        g outages and reliance by small scale businesses, 
        industries and affluent individuals on off-grid generation [12]. 
        The poor state of power supply in Nigeria was widely viewed as one 
        of the major constraints to the nation’s economic growth [10]. While Nigeria has an abundant supply of natural resources, including large reserves of oil and gas, it had one of the lowest net electricity generations.
        Nigeria loses $25 billion 
        (N75 trillion at the current exchange rate of N305 per dollar) yearly due to irregular electricity supply.
        A report from the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN) in 2016 shows  that member companies in the past years (2013 – 2015) spent N20.8 billion, monthly on power generation to run production process. The ripple effects of power shortages and constant outages are numerous to the industries. This ranges from cut down in production, job loss to outright closure or relocation to other countries. Companies bear so much loss as outages often occur when goods are in the middle of production. When power is taken unannounced in the process of production, all goods are destroyed. Many MAN members generate power privately and cut of dependence on the national grid. The consequence of incurring high cost of power generation from the industries makes the nations industries less competitive. A 2015 report on the Good Governance Initiative (GGI), say Nigerians spent N3.5 trillion on fuelling their generators annually and N2 trillion spent on running generators by over 17 million small and medium scale enterprises, banks, other corporate entities and traders across the country.
