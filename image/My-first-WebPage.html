    It can be inferred that an improved and stable power supply is vital to boost the growth of any economy. Many functions necessary to present day living comes to a halt when the supply of energy stops or fluctuates. The greater the per capital consumption of electric power in a country, the higher the standard of living of its people. The survival of industrial undertakings and our social structures depends primarily upon low cost and uninterrupted power supply. There is therefore need for an improved and regular electric power supply in the country. This work aims to show that an improved power supply Nigeria is a panacea to her industrial/economic development.
d. Nigeria Some scholars have argued that power supply is vital for industrial development and is a major challenge confronting the Nigerian economy. For instance, it is a well known fact that the development of Nigerian economy as an emerging market is technically a function of adequate provision and supply of electricity power. Similarly, poor power generation represents a major setback for Nigeria’s industrial development. For several decades (1990 – 2019), inadequate quantity, quality and access to electricity service remain a big challenge to the Nigerian economy and the resolution of the challenge would boost the economy, reduce unemployment and the resultant social vices. A casual test indicated the absence of a causal link between industrial/economic growth and electricity supply in Nigeria. This implies that electricity supply has not impacted significantly on economic growth in Nigeria owing to the electricity crises that has paralyzed economic activities over the years (1990 – 2019). According to research on improving and sustaining power (electricity) supply for socio economic development in Nigeria, it shows that electricity consumption is positively related to economic growth.    An improved electricity supply and consumption will have a diverse impact in a range of socio economic and industrial activities and also on the living standards of Nigerians.
Electrical power is an important component for the development of any economy and hence for prosperity.
According to World Bank report [7], in 2015, about 75 million Nigerians /> lacked access to adequate electricity and Nigeria was ranked highest amongst the countries with electricity access deficit when energy access, efficiency and renewable are on the rise in many developing nations. Much of the electricity distribution network at 2010 -2016 was poorly maintained and the supply in a lot of areas was often described as epileptic in nature, characterized by extreme voltage variations, load discharges, frequent and long outages and reliance by small scale businesses, industries and affluent individuals on off-grid generation.

/> industries and affluent individuals on off-grid generation [12]. The poor state of power supply in Nigeria was widely viewed as one of the major constraints to the nation’s economic growth [10]. While Nigeria has an abundant supply of natural resources, including large reserves of oil and gas, it had one of the lowest net electricity generations.
Nigeria loses $25 billion (N75 trillion at the current exchange rate of N305 per dollar) yearly due to irregular electricity supply.
A report from the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN) in 2016 shows  that member companies in the past years (2013 – 2015) spent N20.8 billion, monthly on power generation to run production process. The ripple effects of power shortages and constant outages are numerous to the industries. This ranges from cut down in production, job loss to outright closure or relocation to other countries. Companies bear so much loss as outages often occur when goods are in the middle of production. When power is taken unannounced in the process of production, all goods are destroyed. Many MAN members generate power privately and cut of dependence on the national grid. The consequence of incurring high cost of power generation from the industries makes the nations industries less competitive. A 2015 report on the Good Governance Initiative (GGI), say Nigerians spent N3.5 trillion on fuelling their generators annually and N2 trillion spent on running generators by over 17 million small and medium scale enterprises, banks, other corporate entities and traders across the country.
